Odoo Pre-Internship Assignment 1 Assigned by Axiom World

In this project, users can add properties that he/she wants to sell. When a property is set to be sold it will generate an invoice in which you can see the invoice date, buyer name, property name, and the ammount at which property is sold.

In this project, I used Odoo 16, PostgreSQL 15, pgAdmin4, and Pycharm to run this project on my Mac machine.

In this project, I had taken help from a few websites like YouTube, Stack Overflow, and Github to solve errors.
